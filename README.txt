Description:
This game is a keyboard-controled "two-stick" shooter that utilizes WASD to move and the arrow keys to shoot in the cardinal direction of their orientation. The goal of the game is to defeat as many of the quick and erratically moving bugs as possible before ultimately perishing as the horde continues to grow. The game utilizes inheritence not just from the nature of an SFML game and the use of its libraries, but also through the use of a base Character class that contributes its characteristics to both the Enemy and Player derived classes. Several custom-made sprites were utilized in the creation of this game, as well as a custom scoreboard, time-tracking, and scorekeeping systems.
