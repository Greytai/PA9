IMPORTANT:
If it is not compiling or not loading, an issue may be that the SFML directory is not correct. Likely, the [user] in the directory is under one of our names- not yours. Which results in an invalid director or an "Graphics.hpp not loading". Similar issue will arise if debug folder is not working.

Thank you!
